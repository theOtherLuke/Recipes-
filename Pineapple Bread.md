## 🔥 Instructions

1. Prepare the Oven and Pan
	1. Preheat oven to 340°F (170°C). (Oven temperatures vary, so begin checking early.)
	2. Brush the loaf pan with melted butter, making sure to coat corners and edges.
	3. Optionally, line the bottom with parchment paper for easy release.

2. Prepare the Pineapple
	1.	 Drain the can of pineapple, reserving ¼ cup of the juice for the batter and any extra for glazing later.
	2.	 Chop pineapple chunks into small, blueberry-sized pieces. Set aside.

3. Melt the Butter
 1. Melt the butter gently using a warm-water bath:
 2. Place the butter dish in a bowl of hot tap water until melted and slightly warm to the touch — not hot.

(Tip: Set the butter out the day before so it melts faster.)

In a large bowl, whisk together:
	- Flour
	- ¾ cup sugar (reserve 1 tsp for glaze)
	- Baking powder
	- Baking soda
	- Salt

5. Mix the Wet Ingredients

 1. In a separate bowl, whisk together:
  - Eggs
  - Half & half
  - Pineapple juice
  - Vanilla extract

 2. Once smooth and combined, add the melted butter last, whisking continuously to prevent curdling from temperature differences.

6. Combine Wet and Dry Mixtures

 1. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients.
 2. Fold together gently with a spatula until just combined — avoid overmixing.

7. Add Pineapple

Add the chopped pineapple pieces and fold gently until evenly distributed through the batter.

8. Fill the Pan

 1. Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan.
 2. Tap or gently shake the pan to level and settle the batter evenly.

9. Bake

 1. Bake for 50–60 minutes, checking at 45 minutes.
 2. Insert a toothpick into the center — if it comes out clean, it’s ready for glazing.

10. Add the Glaze

While still in the oven:
	1. Combine remaining pineapple juice with 1 tsp sugar.
	2. Brush the mixture over the top of the loaf, then pour the rest over so it runs down the sides.
	3. Return to the oven and bake for an additional 10 minutes.

⸻

11. Cool and Serve
	1. Remove pan from the oven and place on a cooling rack.
	2. Let the loaf cool in the pan for 10–15 minutes, then remove it and cool completely on the rack.
 3. Slice, serve, and enjoy warm or at room temperature.

## 💡 Notes & Tips
	- Brushing the pan with butter adds flavor and helps develop a crisp golden crust.
	- Adding butter last to the wet mix prevents curdling and ensures even texture.
	- For extra pineapple flavor, brush additional juice over the loaf after baking.
	- Store covered at room temperature for up to 3 days or refrigerate for up to a week.
	- Toasted slices are incredible with a little butter or cream cheese.
